# What is DCO?

DCO stands for Dynamic Creative Optimization, and is a display ad technology that creates personalized ads based on data about the viewer at the moment of ad serving.

Because the creative is both more relevant and also tested and optimized, dynamic ads typically outperform their static counterparts.

One of the most common uses for DCO is product retargeting ads. These ads show dynamic content based a personâ€™s website browsing, such as products viewed or added to a shopping cart.

Dynamic creative ads can also be used for prospecting and other similar campaign goals. These ads often use the common dynamic creative targeting variables of location, behavior, device, demographics, and context.

This above list is not exhaustive. Practically any data source can be connected to a dynamic ad.

Dynamic creative advertisers can also automatically optimize ad creatives based on split and multivariate testing.
